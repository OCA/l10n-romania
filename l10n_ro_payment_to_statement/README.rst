Features:

   -  Adding the payments in the bank statements

   This module added features on customer/supplier payments to allow
   account user to link payment with bank statement direct through
   payment menu or customer/supplier invoices register payment option.
   After selecting and validating payment, module will add bank
   statement line on selected bank statement.

   -  Sequences can be attached to journals, so the invoices/payments
      are not computed by odoo, but taken from the selected sequences:

   ..

      -  Journal sequence: for sale journals, this will be the invoice's
         sequence. For cash/bank journals, this will be the sequence for
         other journal entries (for closing the statement, for statement
         lines etc.)
      -  Customer sequence cash in: only for cash journals. This
         sequence will be used for customer payments
      -  Statement sequence: only for cash/bank journals. This sequence
         will be used for bank/cash statements
      -  Cash in sequence: only for cash. This sequence will be used for
         supplier refunds
      -  Cash out sequence: only for cash. This sequence will be used
         for customer refunds
